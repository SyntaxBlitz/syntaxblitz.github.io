				This page is an eclectic m√©lange of... stuff. From my life. I dunno, I just wanted to have a place where I could put all the silly things I've collected over the years.

				During the COVID-19 pandemic, I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/timothy.j.aveni/videos/2831860003568671/">livestreamed my first self-haircut</a>. A media agency found it, which resulted in this Supercuts ad:

				During a 2019 debate for the US Democratic Party's presidential nomination, Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/joe-30330.html">flubbed</a> and accidentally directed viewers to a URL that didn't exist. I couldn't help myself. I bought the domain, redirecting it to a friend's <a href="http://joe30330.com/">joke campaign website</a> that he and I had built for April Fool's Day. My friend got plenty of attention (the Huffington Post calls us <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-text-flub_n_5d425a4be4b0acb57fc72014">Biden-Trolling Pranksters</a>) and interviewed that night with a few news organizations running the story.

				In high school, I helped write and advocate for the passage of the <a href="https://coldcaseact.com/">Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2017</a>, possibly the first bill ever written by high schoolers to be signed into federal law. I lobbied congressional staffers in Washington, D.C. and built out social engagement features on the website.

				When I was young, my dad maintained a family personal website, which I've <a href="http://aveni.family/2003/">reuploaded for posterity</a>. In 2007 (when I was 9), I had my own go at overhauling the website. I've (reluctantly) reuploaded <a href="http://aveni.family/">that one</a>, too (incidentally, this website is the reason I first learned about colorblindness).
