        Most of my time is spent now on <a href="/research">research</a>-related
        projects; I haven’t ever done a great job of maintaining this page,
        which mostly catalogues technical but non-research-related projects, up
        to date since around 2019.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thought maybe I’d split this page by how <em>public</em> the projects
        are, whether or not they’re still around (indeed, some were ephemeral to
        begin with). Not every project is described very well, and some do not
        have their code or materials made public, so you may have to use your
        imagination.

            This one is a funny story. Old School RuneScape had launched an
            ephemeral gamemode that I really enjoyed playing, but it quickly
            became clear that the temporary gamemode had a major UI design flaw
            that the developers couldn’t invest time into fixing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The night I learned that no improvements were forthcoming, I wrote a
            plugin for the game to address the issues. Although the gamemode
            only lasted another month or two, this quickly became some of the
            highest-impact code I had ever authored outside of my industry work;
            according to the plugin’s download metrics, it was ultimately used
            by ~70k players, roughly one third of the playerbase for that
            gamemode.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the plugin
            <em>saved Leagues III</em>, but I also wouldn’t stop
            <a href="https://youtu.be/IcfZyY3paM0?t=835">someone else</a> from

            This project is dear to me because it was my first public project
            whose goal was not to create a technical artifact that would serve
            some purpose but rather to use design to communicate a new concept,
            an idea for a crowdsourcing platform that the open stenography
            community might find valuable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea was quickly picked up by the community, even though I
            wasn’t really able to dedicate my own time to the development of the
            actual software project. I don’t think it has come to fruition yet,
            but even years later, the community discusses this idea largely in
            the framing of my original pitch, including using the name
            “chordial”.

            Now, although I teach User Interface Design and Development, much of
            my background is in the <em>development</em> side of things. I’m
            grateful to have such a concrete example of the value of design as a
            communication tool, and that’s why I take such pride in this
            project.

            There was a time that I was one of the two developers of what was,
            if I remember correctly, the most popular Minecraft server plugin
            for playing Spleef. SpleefUltimate was a fork of SpleefExtreme, but
            any details beyond that may be lost to time; my memory ain’t what it
            used to be. I remember that my contributions weren’t exactly
            <em>good</em> code, but back in 2012 you really did not need to be
            writing good code to be a successful Minecraft plugin developer.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 10pt">
            Fun additional fact: I also wrote one of the very first Minecraft
            plugins that would automatically synchronize your donations, made on
            a companion website, to the game server, offering in-game perks.
            It’s possible there were others before me, but none were known to me
            at the time; this was well before there were well-established
            megaservers. We were a bunch of kids running around in a block land.

          <p>
            When I was a kid, you couldn’t use alpha values for HTML/CSS colors,
            at least not reliably. We were still trying to support IE6,
            remember?
          </p>
          <p>
            But what you <em>could</em> do was use a 1x1 pixel image as your
            background. I wrote a script with PHP-GD to generate these images
            dynamically, based on the URL (good ol’ <code>mod_rewrite</code> so
            it’d look like a real image), and I used it on my Neopets pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            After mentioning it on a Neopets forum, it started to see steady
            usage. It might be the true first “public service” project I made as
            a young software developer, and I <em>still</em> see occasional
            requests to my server logs for those little pngs. Unfortunately, I’m
            pretty sure I've purged PHP from that web server many times over by
            now.

            UC Berkeley’s User Interface Design and Development course includes
            programming assignments. These involved a pretty heavy manual
            grading load, since TAs had to grade both functionality and
            aesthetics. To help the class scale, I converted the course’s
            programming assignments so that their functionality could be graded

            2024. I folded in my desires to deliver interactive lectures, take

            You’ll have to excuse the lack of detail on this one... this is a
            pretty fun idea, and I want to keep its powder dry in case I do try
            to actually put it out there someday (the source code is an absolute
            dumpster fire at the moment).

            When YouTube removed the “dislike” count from videos, a bunch of
            people scrambled to crowdsource the information so that it could be
            restored to YouTube videos. Video creators could, in theory, use the
            YouTube API to upload their own videos’ dislike counts to a public
            server (and there was some appetite for this), but YouTube’s OAuth
            scopes were too permissive for creators to be comfortable handing
            over the relevant data to the authors of the “Return YouTube
            Dislike” browser extension.

            Interested in the technical challenge (while simultaneously being a
            bit pessimistic about the likelihood of any movement in this
            direction), I investigated and crafted a solution that could
            (theoretically) leave everyone happy. The solution involved a whole
            lot of hackery and a deep-dive into how TLS encryption works.
